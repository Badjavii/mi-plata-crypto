### Project Description

The project consists of a management system for buying and selling digital assets (stocks and cryptocurrencies). This software provides a graphical interface and guides the user through signing up or logging in, editing their account, checking their balance and portfolio, checking prices and metrics for the assets available in the system, and buying and selling the assets they desire.
